👋 Hi, I'm Dana!

🎓 I'm a mechatronics engineering student passionate about **bridging software and hardware** to create meaningful and intelligent systems.

🔧 Currently exploring:
- 🤖 Robotics & embedded systems
- 📊 Python libraries for control & visualization (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy)
- 💻 MATLAB for signal processing and system modeling
- 📄 LaTeX for professional reports and circuit documentation
- 💡 C++ for efficient, low-level programming and control logic

📌 Goals for 2025:
- Build and document robotics + embedded systems projects
- Learn by doing and contribute to impactful tech
- Strengthen my portfolio for internships & research opportunities

✨ Let’s connect!
